# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to Shoolin GUI!

The project layout is currently fairly straight forward. It uses the kivy TextInput to take the input from the user and parse the data to the python code.

Code for GUI is written in "start.kv" file and the respective backend is written in "Shoolin_GUI.py" file. In order to provide a new feature -
* Add a proper widget type to the new feature. Only add a text input id deemed necessary.
* Provide a meaningful name to the id (in start.kv) and its corresponding variable to the main python file.
* Provide a docstring to the function/method (if created).
* Try to use PEP8 guidelines.

Pull Requests are most welcome.

<b><u>Make sure whether you have installed the application without any issues.</u></b>
